# How IF uses data

Projects by IF is a limited company based in London, England. We run this website ([projectsbyif.com](https://projectsbyif.com)) and its subdomains. We also use third party services to publish work, keep in touch with people and understand how we can do those things better. Many of those services collect some data about people who are interested in IF, come to our events or work with us.

Here you can find out what those services are, how we use them and how we store the information they collect. You can also find out about how we handle data for other purposes, including user research, job applications and for the people that work at IF.

This page was updated on 24 May 2018. You can see any revisions by [visiting this repository on Github](https://github.com/projectsbyif/how-if-uses-data).

## Principles

At IF, we take our approach to data very seriously, so we’ve set some guiding principles that all of our work follows:

**Minimising the data we collect and record**

We ask for as little information as possible. It reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data, and means people have more control over what they share with us.

**Being clear about data use**

We’re up front about what we’ll do with information: how we store it, who’ll have access to it and when we’ll delete it. If we won’t use it, we don’t keep it.

**Making decisions as a team**

No single person has all the answers. We talk about decisions we’re making about using data. Ideally, we write a blog post about it: public discussion is essential.

**Storing data securely**

No one should be able to access our data without permission, either by accident or design.

**Keeping personally identifiable information confidential**

Outside of the team working on a project, the information we share about people are high-level findings.

**Holding people to account**

Someone should always be responsible for decisions made about our use of data. This person must be able to explain every decision made about the way a project’s data has been gathered, used and managed.

## Our websites

We use the following services to run our websites and understand how people are using them.

### Matomo

We track visitors to IF’s website using analytics software called [Matomo](https://matomo.org), which logs a visitor’s activity on our website. We then use this to work out how we can improve the site. We store the data collected indefinitely, so we can see how use of our website changes over time.

We chose Matomo because we are able to run it on equipment we control, so no third parties have access to this data. Matomo have [listed what data their software collects](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_18254/) about visitors to our websites, and have also written about their [approach to privacy](https://matomo.org/privacy/).

You can opt out of analytics by turning on Do Not Track in your browser. Find out how to do this for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2790761?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature), [Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21416?locale=en_US), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17288/windows-internet-explorer-11-use-do-not-track), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17288/windows-internet-explorer-11-use-do-not-track) and [Microsoft Edge](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy).

### Digital Ocean

We run our website on servers owned by [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com). We chose them because we control the server, and because that server is based in the UK. You can read about Digital Ocean’s approach to customer data on [their privacy page](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy/).

### GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host public and private code related to our projects. Using GitHub allows people to scrutinise code changes, and we can easily open up our code to contributors from outside of the IF team. You can read GitHub’s privacy statement [on their website](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

### Vimeo

We host videos using [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com), because its infrastructure is better suited to delivering video content than our own. Using Vimeo also allows us to edit the content of a video without breaking copies embedded on other websites. You can read Vimeo’s privacy policy [on their website](https://vimeo.com/privacy).

### Amazon Web Services

We host images using [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). We use AWS S3 because it’s reliable and integrates easily with our CMS, [Craft](https://craftcms.com/).

We have disabled the logging features of S3, but Amazon may log IP addresses to protect the security of their systems. We have signed a [Data Protection Addendum](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en) with Amazon to ensure protections approved by the European Commission are in place.

You can read more about Amazon AWS and privacy in their [Data Privacy FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/).

## Trust & Design meetup

[Trust & Design](https://trustanddesign.projectsbyif.com) is a meetup event we run for people who are thinking about data and privacy. We use [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.co.uk) to handle signups and ticketing. We do this because it’s a ticketing service members of the team have experience using, and because it allows us to promote each event to other people interested in similar events.

When someone signs up to an event through Eventbrite, we’ll only use that information to get in touch about that specific event. After the event, we delete any information about attendees from Eventbrite.

You can read Eventbrite’s privacy policy [on their website](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy). Section 7 provides information about how to exercise your data rights on their service.

### At the event

We’ll check before each event whether attendees consent to being filmed or photographed by members of the IF team. If you’ve attended one of our events and have since changed your mind about whether you consent to being filmed or photographed, or if you find you’ve been filmed or photographed against your consent, email [data@projectsbyif.com](mailto:data@projectsbyif.com) and we’ll take steps to meet your needs.

If a speaker consents, we film their talk so we can publish it after the event. This film is also transcribed to ensure that what the speaker says is accessible. This transcript will be published verbatim, unless a speaker wants to review and edit it. We won’t publish footage of Q&As if we haven’t received consent from all participants.

## Our social media accounts

We use several social media accounts to share our work and the things we publish. At the moment, these include:

* [Projects by IF on Twitter](https://twitter.com/@projectsbyif) ([Privacy policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy#update))
* [Projects by IF on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/10589574) ([Privacy policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy))
* [Writing by IF on Medium](https://medium.com/writing-by-if) ([Privacy policy](https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9))
* [IF Policy Research on Medium](https://medium.com/if-policy-research) ([Privacy policy](https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9))
* [Projects by IF on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/projectsbyif/) ([Privacy policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content))

We occasionally use the analytics tools provided by these platforms to understand how we can use these services better.

We may also feature public messages, comments or replies on [celebrate.projectsbyif.com](https://celebrate.projectsbyif.com/).

If you’d like content about you removed from this site or any of our social media profiles, please contact [data@projectsbyif.com](mailto:data@projectsbyif.com).

## Research participants

Research is an important part of our process. It helps us understand people’s needs and build better products and services.

### Asking for consent

All research participants are given a consent form, outlining what the research involves, what information will be recorded and how it will be used. If the participant is happy to proceed we ask them to sign the form to confirm. We scan signed consent forms and shred paper copies. We store consent forms on Google Drive and keep these for 6 years, when they are then deleted.

At the moment, we do not conduct any research with people under the age of 18.

You can view an example of [our informed consent form on GitHub](https://github.com/projectsbyif/user-research-resources).

### Using information from research

Research material is separated from any identifiable information, including the consent forms, while we are working with it.

Any notes we gather during research sessions are stored securely in a locked cabinet in our office. Any digital files (like audio, photos and videos) are stored on Google Drive and are only accessed by members of the team involved in the research. At the end of the project, notes and digital files are all destroyed or deleted.

Sometimes we may publish quotes from research sessions. We only do this if we have specific consent from the participant and any personally identifiable information has been removed. We will only publish audio, photos and video from a research session if a participant has given consent and has signed a model release form.

### Withdrawing from research

Participants are able to withdraw their information from a project at any time. To do this, contact [data@projectsbyif.com](mailto:data@projectsbyif.com).

## Job Applicants

We use several services to help us find people to join our team. At the moment, this includes:

* [Workable](https://www.workable.com/) ([Privacy policy](https://www.workable.com/privacy))
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) ([Privacy policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy))
* [The Guardian Jobs](https://jobs.theguardian.com/) ([Privacy policy](https://jobs.theguardian.com/privacy-policy/))
* [Escape to the City](https://www.escapethecity.org/) ([Privacy policy](https://www.escapethecity.org/privacy-policy/))

Only specific team members involved in the recruitment process have access to these accounts or anything related to job applications, like CV’s and emails. We don’t collect any [special category data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/) or ask for any background checks as part of the application process.

If you want to exercise your rights on a particular service, please refer to its privacy policy for more information.

## People who work at IF

When people join IF, we request information about them needed for [tax purposes](https://www.gov.uk/new-employee/employee-information) and [confirmation of their right to work in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/check-job-applicant-right-to-work). We also hold information about their role and their professional development at IF. Who can access this information is controlled. Information about what is stored is available in our handbook.

## Things we don't do

IF doesn't participate in the following data processing activities:

* Buying or selling marketing lists
* Entering into data sharing agreements with other organisations
* Telephone marketing
* Postal marketing
* CCTV surveillance (apart from CCTV systems run by the buildings we work in)

We don't use "[soft opt-in](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/electronic-and-telephone-marketing/electronic-mail-marketing/)". This means you won't receive any marketing communication from us unless you have specifically agreed to it, even if you have attended one of our events or applied for a job at IF.

## Keeping data secure

We carefully choose what services and tools we use at IF. It’s important that they follow good security practices, like HTTPS, two-factor authentication and the ability to set a strong password. We have reviewed the privacy policies and security practices of everything we use.

When a new team member joins IF, we explain best practices for keeping their devices secure, maintaining the security of their online accounts and working outside our offices.

Infrastructure we maintain ourselves, like our Digital Ocean servers, are secured using best practices. Some of these are [outlined in this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04). Only specific members of the team can access these servers.

## Data breaches

In the event of a data breach, we are required to notify the Information Commissioner’s Office. We will do so following [their guidance outlined on this page](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/personal-data-breaches/).

## Data transfer outside the EEA

We have reviewed the policies of the services we use to make sure adequate protections are maintained when information is shared outside of the European Economic Area.

## Exemptions

There are exemptions to data protection regulations that may require us to share data about you. These include requests by law enforcement. A full list of exemptions are listed [on the ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/). This also applies to data held about you by third party services we use.

## Reviewing this document

Every quarter, we review our documentation of the data we handle and third party services we use. This helps us continuously improve our processes and hold ourselves to account.

We will review and update this document as necessary. You can see any revisions by visiting [this repository on Github](https://github.com/projectsbyif/how-if-uses-data).
