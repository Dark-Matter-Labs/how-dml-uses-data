#How IF uses data
Projects by IF is a limited company based in London, England. We run this website ([projectsbyif.com](https://projectsbyif.com/)) and its subdomains. We also use third party services to publish work, keep in touch with people, and understand how we can do those things better. Many of those services collect some data about people who are interested in IF, come to our events or work with us.

On this page we’ll list the services and processes we use to manage and understand that data. If you’ve got any questions about how we use data, or want to make a subject access request, contact [hello@projectsbyif.com](mailto:hello@projectsbyif.com)

##Principles
We take our approach to data very seriously at IF. Our use and management of data is governed by some high-level principles that are worth stating up front:

_Ask for as little as possible_ - Data minimisation is crucial. Ask for as little as you can and record even less. It minimises risk, both to IF and to the people we collect information about.

_Be clear about data use_ - Be up front about what you’ll do with information, how you’ll store it, who will have access to it and when you’ll delete it. If you won’t use it, don’t keep it.

_Make decisions as a team_ - No single person has all the answers. Talk about decisions you’re making about using data. Ideally, blog about it: public discussion is valuable.

_Store data securely_ - Make sure data is stored appropriately. No-one should be able to access it without permission, either by accident or malice.

_Don’t share personally identifiable information_ - Outside of the team working on a project, the closest someone should be able to get to raw data is a high-level synthesis of what you find.

_Be accountable_ - Someone should always be responsible for decisions made about our use of data. This person must be able to explain every decision made about how to use and manage data.

##Visitors to IF’s websites
We track visitors to IF’s website using analytics platform [Piwik](https://piwik.org/privacy/). We chose Piwik because we could run this on IF’s server, so no third parties have access to this data. You can read [what information Piwik collects](https://piwik.org/faq/general/faq_18254/) on their website. We use this to learn how we can improve the website and the content on it for people who visit it. We will store it indefinitely, so we can see these trends over time. You can read about Piwik’s approach to privacy, and which tools they recommend to anonymise your browsing, at [piwik.org/privacy](https://piwik.org/privacy). You can also opt-out of being tracked by Piwik by checking a box on that page.

We run our website on servers owned by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). We chose Digital Ocean because we could control the server, and because that server is based in the UK. You can read about Digital Ocean’s approach to customer data, including their privacy policy and transparency report, at [digitalocean.com/legal](http://www.digitalocean.com/legal).

We use [Github](https://github.com/) to release code related to our projects. We use this because allows people to scrutinise code changes, and because we can easily open up contributions to code or content from people outside of IF. To read Github’s privacy policy, visit [help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

We host videos using [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/). We use Vimeo because it has infrastructure better suited to to delivering video content than our own, and because it allows us to edit to content of videos (in response to, for instance, a change of consent or a copyright notice) without breaking embedded videos. You can read Vimeo’s privacy policy at [vimeo.com/privacy](https://vimeo.com/privacy).

We host images using [Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). We use AWS S3 because it’s reliable and integrates easily with our CMS, [Craft](https://craftcms.com/). It is not currently clear whether Amazon collects information about the use of content hosted on its platform. You can read more at [aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/)

##Newsletter subscribers
_If you subscribed to the newsletter on projectsbyif.com then the information about how we use data about visitors to the website is also relevant to you._

IF’s ‘Notes from the studio’ mailing list is maintained using a version of [Sendy](https://sendy.co/) run on IF’s server. We use Sendy so we can disable much of the tracking bundled with many email services. Besides storing the email addresses subscribed to a list, Sendy tracks whether an email has bounced from a recipient or been marked as spam. This information will be kept indefinitely, unless a recipient unsubscribes from the mailing list. We do monthly audits to make sure information about unsubscribed email addresses is deleted from Sendy, including any data associated with these email addresses. However some of this data may be stored in backups. We’re in the process of changing how we store this information so that it is processed during our monthly audits.

The newsletter is sent via [Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). We do this because it improves the reliability of newsletter distribution. It is not clear how Amazon SES handles personally identifiable information it processes. To read more, visit [aws.amazon.com/ses/faqs](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/faqs/).

##Trust & Design meetup attendees

We use [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/) to handle event signups and ticketing. We do this because it’s a ticketing service members of the team have experience using, and helps us promote an event beyond our immediate network. We only use the content submitted to manage a single event. We don’t get notifications with details about individual ticket holders. After an event has taken place we will delete it from Eventbrite as part of our monthly audit, and ensure that we don’t have any records about individual attendees. You can read Eventbrite’s privacy policy at [eventbrite.co.uk/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy).

We will check before each event whether each attendee consents to being filmed or photographed by members of the IF team. If you change your mind, or if you find you’ve been included in a video or photograph from the event against your wishes, please contact [hello@projectsbyif.com](mailto:hello@projectsbyif.com) and we’ll take steps to meet your needs.

With a speaker's consent, we will film their talk to publish it following the event. This film will also be transcribed to ensure that the content in it is accessible. This transcript will be published verbatim, unless a speaker requests a review of the content and takes steps to edit it. We will not publish footage of Q+A’s without explicitly asking for consent from all participants.
