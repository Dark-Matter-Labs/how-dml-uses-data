# **Privacy Policy**

## **Who we are:**

Dark Matter Labs (DML) is a strategic discovery, design and development lab working to transition society in response to technological revolution and climate breakdown. We run this website ([darkmatterlabs.org/](https://darkmatterlabs.org/)) and its subdomains ([http://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/](http://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/)). 

This privacy policy applies to Dark Matter Labs, a company registered at 217 Mare Street London, E8 3QE United Kingdom. We operate in various offices around the world and have partnerships that are representative of these multiple geographies that we operate within. 

At Dark Matter Labs, we want every individual to know what personal data we collect, why we are collecting it, and for you to know what we do with it. We firmly believe in the right for every individual as a [data subject](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-are-the-data-subject-rights-under-the-gdpr#:~:text=a%20data%20subject%3F-,What%20is%20a%20data%20subject%3F,address%20or%20credit%20card%20number.) to know how their personal data is being used by a [data controller](https://www.atinternet.com/en/glossary/data-controller/#:~:text=A%20data%20controller%20is%20a,Article%204.7%20of%20the%20GDPR.) such as DML, so please get familiar with our Privacy Policy and if you have any questions at all you can reach out to info@darkmatterlabs.org. 

This Privacy Policy is divided into sections based on the way you are interacting with Dark Matter Labs. You are either a Site Visitor, Research Participant, Event Attendee, Partner, or a Prospective Applicant. Please determine what type of user you are and we have explained what information we collect, how we use it, how we store it, and how we may share that information. All of our practices are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information for individuals that live in the UK & European Union.

## **Principles:**

Firstly, we want to make you aware of six principles for which all personal data must be processed according to [Article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) of the GDPR. These principles outline what any company that has a digital presence need to keep accountable towards: 

1. **Lawfulness**, **fairness**, **and transparency**: Obey the law, only process personal data in a way that people would reasonably expect, and always be open about your data protection practices.
2. **Purpose limitation**: You must normally only process personal data for the specific reason you collected it and nothing else.
3. **Data minimization**: don't process any more data than you need.
4. **Accuracy**: Make sure that any personal data you hold is adequate and accurate.
5. **Storage limitation**: Don't store personal data for longer than you need to.
6. **Integrity and confidentiality**: Always process personal data securely.

These principles build the foundation for why data is being collected and all of the data that DML is collecting has to fall in line with one of these six principles.

## Research participants

As a discovery organisation, research is an important part of our work: it helps us understand people’s needs and build better products and services. We treat all the notes, recordings and other data you collect during our research as personal data.

At the moment, we do not conduct any research with people under the age of 18.

### What data we collect

We collect the following information from research participants:

*Participant information*

- Full name

- Email address
- Address

*Consent forms*

- Signature

*Research material*

- Interview recordings (audio or video)

- Notes
- Photos

### Why we collect this data

We collect participant information to identify participants, and arrange sessions and follow-ups.

All research participants are given a consent form that outlines what the research involves, what information will be recorded and how it will be used. If the participant is happy to proceed we ask them to sign the form to confirm this.

We collect research material to reference during project work.

### How long we keep research data

Participant information is deleted at the end of the project.

Our consent forms are kept on file for 6 years. All notes and digital files are destroyed or deleted 2 years after the research session. We delete any personal information provided to us from the research recruiter when the project has finished.

### Where research data is processed and stored

Research material is separated from any identifiable information, such as consent forms, while we are working with it.

Any notes we gather during research sessions are stored securely. Any digital files (like audio, photos and videos) are stored on Google Drive and are only accessed by DML team members involved in the research. We may send audio of the research session to a transcriber if necessary. We review the privacy notices of the companies we use for this and ask for explicit consent from participants in our consent forms.

We may use research materials like quotes, photos, audio or video clips, in presentations to clients. We will only do this if we have consent from participants. We don’t connect this information to participants’ names.

Sometimes we may publish quotes from research sessions. We only do this if we have specific consent from the participant and any personally identifiable information has been removed. We will only publish audio, photos and video from a research session if a participant has given consent and has signed a model release form.

### Opt-out of collection

Participants are able to withdraw their information from a project at any time. To do this, contact [info@darkmatterlabs.org](mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org).
