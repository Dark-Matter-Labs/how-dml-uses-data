Dark Matter Labs is a strategic discovery, design and development lab working to transition society in response to technological revolution and climate breakdown.
We run this website ([darkmatterlabs.org/](https://darkmatterlabs.org/)) and its subdomains.

We use third party services to publish work, keep in touch with people and understand how we can do both of these things better. Here you can find out what these services are and how we handle data for visitors to our websites, user research participants, potential and existing clients, and job applicants.

## Our websites

### What data we collect

We collect the following information about visitors to our websites:

* IP address (first two bytes)
* Timestamp of visit
* Country of visit
* Referrer
* Operating system
* Browser
* Screen resolution
* Device type
* Device brand and model
* Pages visited during session

### Why we collect website data

Our website analytics allows us to see how people are using our sites and improve their experience.

### How long we keep website data

We anonymise the data we collect and store it indefinitely, so we can see how use of our website changes over time.

### Where website data is processed and stored

We use an analytics software called [Matomo](https://matomo.org). We run Matomo through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). Their approach to customer data is outlined in [their privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

### Third-party services

We also use third-party services to host and deliver website content. You can find out more about each of these services below:

#### Cargo

DML's website is built and hosted by [Cargo](https://cargo.site/), their approach to GDPR is highlighred [here](https://support.cargo.site/GDPR-and-Cargo) and also reflected in their [Privacy Policy](https://cargo.site/Privacy)

#### Medium

We host our blog on [Medium](https://medium.com), because its infrastructure is better suited to delivering blog content than our own. Find out more about how they use data in their [privacy statement](https://policy.medium.com/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9).

#### Our social media accounts

We use several social media accounts to share our work. We occasionally use the analytics tools provided by these platforms to understand how we can use these services better. Our social media accounts include:

* [Dark Matter Labs on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DarkMatter_Labs) ([Privacy policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy#update))
* [Dark Matter Labs on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/darkmatterlabs) ([Privacy policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy))

## Research participants

Research is an important part of our work: it helps us understand people’s needs and build better products and services.

At the moment, we do not conduct any research with people under the age of 18.

### What data we collect

We collect the following information from research participants:

*Participant information*

* Full name
* Telephone number
* Email address
* Address

*Consent forms*

* Full name
* Signature

*Research material*

* Interview recordings (audio or video)
* Quotes
* Notes
* Photos

### Why we collect this data

We collect participant information to identify participants, and arrange sessions and follow-ups.

All research participants are given a consent form that outlines what the research involves, what information will be recorded and how it will be used. If the participant is happy to proceed we ask them to sign the form to confirm this.

We collect research material to reference during project work.

### How long we keep research data

Participant information is deleted at the end of the project.

We scan signed consent forms and shred paper copies, then store consent forms on Google Drive and keep these for 6 years.
All notes and digital files are destroyed or deleted 2 years after the research session. We delete any personal information provided to us from the research recruiter when the project has finished.

### Where research data is processed and stored

Research material is separated from any identifiable information, such as consent forms, while we are working with it.

Any notes we gather during research sessions are stored securely. Any digital files (like audio, photos and videos) are stored on Google Drive and are only accessed by DML team members involved in the research. We may send audio of the research session to a transcriber if necessary. We review the privacy notices of the companies we use for this and ask for explicit consent from participants in our consent forms.

We may use research materials like quotes, photos, audio or video clips, in presentations to clients. We will only do this if we have consent from participants. We don’t connect this information to participants’ names.

Sometimes we may publish quotes from research sessions. We only do this if we have specific consent from the participant and any personally identifiable information has been removed. We will only publish audio, photos and video from a research session if a participant has given consent and has signed a model release form.

### Opt-out of collection

Participants are able to withdraw their information from a project at any time. To do this, contact [info@darkmatterlabs.org](mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org).

* Full name
* Telephone number
* Email address
* Job title and Company

*During or after the event*

* Video and audio of the event (audio or video)

* Feedback

### Why we collect this data

We collect attendee information to send the event invitation, provide help should there be any issues joining the event and to reach out for feedback.

We usually record the events we run so we can share them with people who were unable to attend. We may use comments we receive in the event itself to promote future events. All Attendees are told that the event will be recorded prior to the event starting.

We collect feedback to improve these events for Attendees.

### How long we keep Attendee data

Attendee Registration data is deleted after 2 years after the event.

Videos of the events and the feedback we receive is kept indefinitely unless we are asked to remove it.

### Where Attendee is processed and stored

All Attendee data is stored on Google Drive and is only accessed by DML team members.

We may use feedback materials like quotes, photos, audio or video clips, in presentations to clients. We will only do this if we have consent from Attendees. We don’t connect this information to Attendees’ names.

Sometimes we may publish quotes from the events we run. We only do this if we have specific consent from the Attendee. We will only publish audio, photos and video from an event if an Attendee has given consent and has signed a model release form.

### Third-party services

We also use third-party services to plan, deliver and host event content. You can find out more about each of these services below:

## Things we don't do

DML doesn't participate in the following data processing activities:

* Buying or selling marketing lists
* Entering into data sharing agreements with other organisations
* Postal marketing
* CCTV surveillance (apart from CCTV systems run by the buildings in which we work)

We don't use "[soft opt-in](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/electronic-and-telephone-marketing/electronic-mail-marketing/)", meaning you won't receive any marketing communications from us unless you've specifically agreed to it.

## Keeping data secure

We carefully choose our services and tools at Dark Matter Labs. It’s important that they follow good security practices, like HTTPS, two-factor authentication and the ability to set a strong password. We've reviewed the privacy policies and security practices of everything we use.

When a new team member joins DML, we explain best practices for keeping their devices secure, maintaining the security of their online accounts and working outside our offices.

Infrastructure we maintain ourselves, like our Digital Ocean servers, are secured using [these best practices](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04). Only specific members of the team can access these servers.

## Data breaches

In the event of a data breach, we are required to notify the Information Commissioner’s Office. We will do so following [their guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/personal-data-breaches/).

## Data transfer outside the EEA

We have reviewed the privacy policies of third party services we use. They provide adequate protections when information is shared outside of the European Economic Area.

## Exemptions

There are exemptions to data protection regulations that may require us to share data about you, including requests by law enforcement. A full list of exemptions are listed [on the ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/) – this also applies to data held about you by third party services we use.

## Reviewing how we use data

Every quarter, we review our documentation of the data we handle and third party services we use. This helps us continuously improve our processes and hold ourselves to account. We will update this document as necessary.
