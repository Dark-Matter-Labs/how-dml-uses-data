# How IF uses data

Projects by IF is a limited company based in London, England. We run this website ([projectsbyif.com](https://projectsbyif.com/)) and its subdomains. We also use third party services to publish work, keep in touch with people and understand how we can do those things better. Many of those services collect some data about people who are interested in IF, come to our events or work with us.

Here you can find out what those services are, how we use them and how we store the information they collect. If you’ve got any questions, or want to know more about data we might have collected about you, email [hello@projectsbyif.com](mailto:hello@projectsbyif.com)

## Principles
At IF, we take our approach to data very seriously, so we’ve set some guiding principles that all of our work follows:

**Minimising the data we collect and record** - We ask for as little information as possible. It reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data, and means people have more control over what they share with us.

**Being clear about data use** - We’re up front about what we’ll do with information: how we store it, who’ll have access to it and when we’ll delete it. If we won’t use it, we don’t keep it.

**Making decisions as a team** - No single person has all the answers. We talk about decisions we’re making about using data. Ideally, we write a blog post about it: public discussion is essential.

**Storing data securely** - No one should be able to access our data without permission, either by accident or design.

**Keeping personally identifiable information confidential** - Outside of the team working on a project, the information we share about people is a high-level synthesis.

**Holding people to account** - Someone should always be responsible for decisions made about our use of data. This person must be able to explain every decision made about the way a project’s data has been gathered, used and managed.

## Services powering IF websites
We track visitors to IF’s website using analytics platform <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://matomo.org/"><span itemprop="name">Matomo</span></a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="web analytics" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="Innocraft" />
    <meta itemprop="name" content="InnoCraft Ltd" />
    <meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.innocraft.com/" />
  </span>
</span>, which logs a visitor’s activity on our website: we then use this to work out how we can improve the site. We store the data collected indefinitely, so we can see how use of our website changes over time. We chose Matomo because we are able to run it on equipment we control, so no third parties have access to this data. You can read more about the information Matomo collects on their website [here](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_18254/). You can also read about Matomo's approach to privacy, and which tools they recommend to anonymise your browsing, at [matomo.org/privacy/](https://matomo.org/privacy/), where you can also opt out of being tracked by Matomo.

We run our website on servers owned by <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.digitalocean.com">
    <span itemprop="name">Digital Ocean</span>
  </a>
  <meta itemprop="legalName" content="Digital Ocean LLC" />
  <meta itemprop="address" content="101 Avenue of the Americas 10th Floor New York, NY 10013" />
</span>
We chose them because we control the server, and because that server is based in the UK. You can read about Digital Ocean’s approach to customer data, including their privacy policy and transparency report, [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal).

We use <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://github.com"><span itemprop="name">Github</span></a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="hosting" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="GitHub" />
    <meta itemprop="legalName" content="GitHub, Inc." />
    <meta itemprop="address" content="88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States" />
  </span>
</span>
 to release code related to our projects. Using Github allows people to scrutinise code changes, and we can easily open up our code to contributors from outside of the IF team. Read Github’s privacy policy [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

We host videos using <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://vimeo.com/"><span itemprop="name">Vimeo</span></a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="video hosting" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="Vimeo" />
    <meta itemprop="legalName" content="Vimeo, Inc." />
  </span>
</span>, because its infrastructure is better suited to delivering video content than our own. Using Vimeo also allows us to edit to content of a video without breaking copies embedded on other websites. You can read Vimeo’s privacy policy [here](https://vimeo.com/privacy).

We host images using <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">
    <span itemprop="name">Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3)</span>
  </a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="cloud computing" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="legalName" content="Amazon Web Services, Inc" />
  </span>
</span>. We use AWS S3 because it’s reliable and integrates easily with our CMS, <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://craftcms.com/">
    <span itemprop="name">Craft</span>
  </a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="content management system" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="legalName" content="Pixel &amp; Tonic, Inc." />
  </span>
</span>. It's not currently clear whether Amazon collects information about the use of content hosted on its platform. You can read more [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/).

## Newsletters
We maintain our ‘Notes from IF’ and 'Trust & Design' mailing lists using a service called <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://sendy.co/"><span itemprop="name">Sendy</span></a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="mailing list manager" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="Hex" />
    <meta itemprop="url" content="http://www.hex.sg" />
    <meta itemprop="taxId" content="53104117D" />
  </span>
</span>, which we run on IF’s servers. We use Sendy because it allows us to switch off the tracking features that are bundled into many email services. Besides storing subscribers' email addresses, Sendy tracks whether an email has bounced from a recipient or been marked as spam. We’ll keep this information indefinitely, unless a recipient unsubscribes from a mailing list. We do monthly audits to make sure information about unsubscribed email addresses is deleted, however some of this data may be stored in backups. We’re currently changing how we store this information so that it is processed during our monthly audits.

The newsletter is sent via <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">
    <span itemprop="name">Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)</span>
  </a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="cloud computing" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="legalName" content="Amazon Web Services, Inc" />
  </span>
</span>, which we use because it improves the reliability of newsletter distribution. It’s not currently clear how Amazon SES handles personally identifiable information it processes. You can read more  [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/faqs/).

## Trust & Design meetup
We use <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebApplication">
  <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/"><span itemprop="name">Eventbrite</span></a>
  <meta itemprop="applicationCategory" content="event listing" />
  <span itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="Eventbrite" />
    <meta itemprop="legalName" content="Eventbrite, Inc" />
    <meta itemprop="address" content="155 5th Street, Floor 7, San Francisco, CA 94103" />
  </span>
</span> to handle event signups and ticketing. We do this because it’s a ticketing service members of the team have experience of using, and because it allows us to promote each event to other people interested in similar events. When someone signs up to an event through Eventbrite, we’ll only use that information to get in touch about that specific event. We don’t keep copies of their information afterwards, and after an event has taken place we delete it from Eventbrite as part of our monthly audit. You can read Eventbrite’s privacy policy [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy).

We’ll check before each event whether attendees consent to being filmed or photographed by members of the IF team. If you’ve attended one of our events and have since changed your mind about whether you consent to being filmed or photographed, or if you find you’ve been filmed or photographed against your consent, email [hello@projectsbyif.com](mailto:hello@projectsbyif.com) and we’ll take steps to meet your needs.

If a speaker consents, we film their talk so we can publish it after the event. This film is also transcribed to ensure that what the speaker says is accessible. This transcript will be published verbatim, unless a speaker wants to review and edit it. We won’t publish footage of Q&As if we haven’t asked for consent from all participants.

## Our social media accounts
